# Using fonts on Web

## üëç Recommended `@font-face` rules

You can see/copy-and-paste a complete example of the recommended rules in [`fonts/web/font-faces.css`](fonts/web/font-faces.css).

These are based on the Source typography guidelines and map to the helpers in [`@guardian/source-foundations`](https://guardian.github.io/csnx/?path=/docs/source-foundations_typography--docs).

They will make the following typefaces and font variants available on the page:

| Typeface                   | font-family                | font-weight | font-style |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------: | :--------: |
| **Guardian Headline**      | `"GH Guardian Headline"`   |    `300`    |  `normal`  |
|                            | `"GH Guardian Headline"`   |    `300`    |  `italic`  |
|                            | `"GH Guardian Headline"`   |    `500`    |  `normal`  |
|                            | `"GH Guardian Headline"`   |    `500`    |  `italic`  |
|                            | `"GH Guardian Headline"`   |    `700`    |  `normal`  |
| **Guardian Text Egyptian** | `"GuardianTextEgyptian"`   |    `400`    |  `normal`  |
|                            | `"GuardianTextEgyptian"`   |    `400`    |  `italic`  |
|                            | `"GuardianTextEgyptian"`   |    `700`    |  `normal`  |
|                            | `"GuardianTextEgyptian"`   |    `700`    |  `italic`  |
| **Guardian Text Sans**     | `"GuardianTextSans"`       |    `400`    |  `normal`  |
|                            | `"GuardianTextSans"`       |    `400`    |  `italic`  |
|                            | `"GuardianTextSans"`       |    `700`    |  `normal`  |
|                            | `"GuardianTextSans"`       |    `700`    |  `italic`  |
| **Guardian Titlepiece**    | `"GT Guardian Titlepiece"` |    `700`    |  `normal`  |

_Note that some web font formats compress better than others (e.g. `woff2` is much smaller than `ttf`). Therefore, not all characters are available on every platform._

_You may notice less common characters are rendered in a different, fallback font, particularly on older browsers._

_This is deliberate in order to balance performance and design fidelity with technical constraints._

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Stylesheet

_Not for production use!_

If you want quick and dirty access to fonts and performance does not matter, you can link to a stylesheet containing the recommended `font-face` rules directly on a page:

```html
<!-- this is slow - do not use it for production Guardian sites -->
<link
    href="https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/fonts/font-faces.css"
    rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

üö® Seriously, this method is the least performant and _not_ what you should use for public-facing production code!

## Custom `@font-face` rules

If the recommended rules are not appropriate for your project, you can use any of the font files from the CDN.

> Be certain you _need_ custom fonts. Your users almost definitely have the recommended fonts already in their cache. Using the recommended fonts will ensure your users see your content and designs _much_ sooner.

### Which version of a font should I use?

You should use the `noalts-not-hinted` version, unless you really cannot.

It provides the best balance between character range and file size.

### How do the font file weights map to CSS weights?

| Font name |         CSS         |
| --------- | :-----------------: |
| Light     | `font-weight: 300;` |
| Regular   | `font-weight: 400;` |
| Medium    | `font-weight: 500;` |
| Semibold  | `font-weight: 600;` |
| Bold      | `font-weight: 700;` |
| Black     | `font-weight: 900;` |

### Example

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'GuardianTextEgyptian';
    src: url('https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/fonts/guardian-textegyptian/noalts-not-hinted/GuardianTextEgyptian-Regular.woff2')
            format('woff2'),
        url('https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/fonts/guardian-textegyptian/noalts-not-hinted/GuardianTextEgyptian-Regular.woff')
            format('woff'),
        url('https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/fonts/guardian-textegyptian/noalts-not-hinted/GuardianTextEgyptian-Regular.ttf')
            format('truetype');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
    font-display: swap;
}
```

## Deployment

All of the files in the [`fonts/web`](fonts/web) directory are continuously deployed on a successful build of the main branch.

## Caching

The cache control value for the font files is set to `max-age=315360000; immutable` (fresh for 10 years).


# Using Fonts on iOS

## Adding the Swift Package To Xcode

To add the `GuardianFonts` Swift Package to your project, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Xcode.

2. Go to `File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency...`.

3. In the search bar, enter the URL `https://github.com/guardian/fonts.git` click `Next`.

4. Select the version rule that suits your needs, then click `Next`.

5. Choose the `GuardianFonts` library and click `Finish`.

Now, the `GuardianFonts` Swift Package should be added to your project and you can import it wherever you need it.

## Using in Another Swift Package

If you're developing a Swift Package and want to use `GuardianFonts`, you can add it as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `Package.swift` file.

2. Add `GuardianFonts` to the dependencies array:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/guardian/fonts.git", branch: "main")
]
```

3. Add `GuardianFonts` as a dependency for your target:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
            name: "YourPackageName",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "GuardianFonts", package: "fonts")
            ]),
]
```

4. Now, you can import `GuardianFonts` in any Swift file in your package.

## Registration 
Custom fonts are registered differently in Swift Packages due to the lack of an info.plist. 
You should use `GuardianFonts.registerFonts()` function to register the fonts contained in this swift package to use in your application. 

If using this from within another **module**, you can do the registration within the module's `init()` function. 

Otherwise, from within a **project** this can be done within the App Delegate `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` function.

## Usage

Wherever you want to use the module you can import it using: 
`import GuardianFonts`

### UIKit
This swift package contains a convenience initialiser on UIFont, allowing you to create a font using a GuardianFontStyle in UIKit. 

Example: 
`let font = UIFont(style: .headlineRegular, size: 30)`

### SwiftUI
This swift package contains a modifier on `View`, allowing you to apply a font using a GuardianFontStyle in SwiftUI. 

Example: 
`Text("Hello World").font(.headlineRegular, size: 30, lineHeight: 34, verticalTrim: .standard)`
